# ILI9341 LCD screen 320x240

This is work in progess!

There are nice libraries for this display, based on the framebuffer library. The drawback is, that too much memory is needed for controlling the display in that way.

The library that is included in this project, is a very ligthweight ili9341 implementation, and only whole .bmp files can be loaded and text can be displayed (in one font, but multple sizes).
